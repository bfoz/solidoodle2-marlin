Marlin firmware for Solidoodle 2

Previous official Solidoodle firmware was based on early version of Marlin and could not be altered to accomodate a Panelolu LCD screen and encoder without many errors. This version has configuration.h and configuration_adv.h altered to reflect all changes found in official Solidoodle firmware.

Instructions:

1. Runs with Arduino0022:

-http://arduino.cc/hu/Main/Software



2. Please use the Sanguino files from:

-https://github.com/jmgiacalone/sanguino1284p

Place the Sanguino folder in arduino-0022\hardware\

Replace the avrdude.conf file in arduino-0022\hardware\tools\avr\etc

This will make the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega644P' AND 'Sanguino W/ ATmega1284P' options appear in the Tools->Board menu.



3. For standard Solidoodle 2 model, upload firmware as is and select the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega644P' option.



4. If adding SDSL SDCARD reader or Panelolu LCD display and rotary encoder with SDSL, you will need to select the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega1284P' board. Please purchase a 1284P with a bootloader already in place.

5. If adding only SDSL, uncomment line 248 in configuration.h from:

//#define SDSUPPORT

to:

#define SDSUPPORT

Now compile and upload.

See instructions above for wiring.



6. If adding Panelolu + SDSL combo, uncomment line 259 from:

//#define ULTIPANEL

to:

#define ULTIPANEL

Now compile and upload.
