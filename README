Marlin firmware for Solidoodle 2

Previous official Solidoodle firmware was based on early version of Marlin and could not be altered to accomodate a Panelolu LCD screen and encoder without many errors. This version has configuration.h and configuration_adv.h altered to reflect all changes found in official Solidoodle firmware.

Instructions:

1. You need to have the Arduino0022 IDE installed. If you have a later version, you'll need to downgrade.

-http://arduino.cc/hu/Main/Software


2. Clone the repository at

-https://github.com/jmgiacalone/sanguino1284p

and copy the included Sanguino directory to the hardware directory of your Arduino install. On Mac OS X, that would be ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware. On Windows it will be arduino-0022\hardware\.

3. If you've upgrade the microcontroller to a 1284P, you'll need to add a new board description to the Arduino IDE. Close the Arduino IDE and then copy the file avrdude.conf from the sanguino1284p clone to your arduino-0022\hardware\tools\avr\etc" directory (That's ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware/tools/avr/etc on OS X).

Start the Arduino IDE and you should now see 'Sanguino W/ ATmega644P' AND 'Sanguino W/ ATmega1284P' options in the Tools->Board menu.

4. For the standard Solidoodle 2 model with the 644P microcontroller, upload the firmware as is and select the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega644P' option.

5. If you're adding an SDSL SDCARD reader, or Panelolu LCD display and rotary encoder with SDSL, you will need to select the 'Sanguino W/ ATmega1284P' board. Please purchase a 1284P with a bootloader already in place.

6. If you're only adding SDSL, uncomment line 248 in configuration.h from:

//#define SDSUPPORT

to:

#define SDSUPPORT

Now compile and upload.

See instructions above for wiring.


7. If you're adding the Panelolu + SDSL combo, uncomment line 259 from:

//#define ULTIPANEL

to:

#define ULTIPANEL

Now compile and upload.
